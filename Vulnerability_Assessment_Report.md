# 🔍 Vulnerability Assessment Report

## 📅 Date  
January 1, 20XX

---

## 🖥️ System Description  
The target system is a high-performance server equipped with a powerful CPU and 128GB of memory. It operates on the latest Linux distribution and hosts a MySQL database. The server utilizes SSL/TLS encryption for secure communication and is connected to other systems via IPv4 addresses on a stable internal network.

---

## 📌 Scope  
This vulnerability assessment focuses on access controls applied to the database server over a three-month period (June 20XX – August 20XX). The assessment is conducted in alignment with **NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1** guidelines.

---

## 🎯 Purpose  
The purpose of this assessment is to evaluate how effectively access controls protect the MySQL database server, which houses critical business data such as customer records, internal documentation, and financial information. Unauthorized access or service downtime could lead to significant operational disruptions and reputational harm.

|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|----------|------|
| **Insider Threat**     | Employee accessing restricted data for curiosity or personal use             | 1          | 2        | 2    |
| **Malicious Actor**    | Attacker using stolen credentials to exfiltrate sensitive data               | 2          | 3        | 6    |
| **Access Misconfig**   | Admin account not deprovisioned after role change                            | 1          | 3        | 3    |
| **Ransomware**         | Malware introduced via phishing or compromised device                        | 3          | 3        | 9    |
| **Unpatched Software** | Exploiting an outdated MySQL vulnerability                                   | 3          | 3        | 9    |
| **Hardware Failure**   | Server shutdown from faulty power supply, causing database corruption        | 1          | 3        | 3    |

## 🧠 Approach  
Each risk was assessed by its likelihood of occurrence and potential impact on operations. The overall goal was to strengthen system security without disrupting essential business functions. The process adhered to NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 for structured and consistent risk analysis.

---

## 🛠️ Remediation Strategy  
To mitigate the identified vulnerabilities, the following actions will be implemented:
- Enforce **strong password policies** and **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**
- Adopt **role-based access control (RBAC)** to limit permissions
- Enable **IP allow-listing** to restrict database access to trusted networks
- Encrypt all data in transit using **TLS**
- Improve auditing and logging to monitor access attempts

These steps aim to protect sensitive systems while improving monitoring and accountability.

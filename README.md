# Cybersecurity Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of hands-on assignments and reports completed as part of my transition into the cybersecurity field. Each project demonstrates foundational knowledge in system hardening, vulnerability assessments, incident handling, and Linux administration. My goal is to continue expanding this portfolio as I grow in my role as an entry-level SOC analyst or threat detection & response professional.
